- Each person occupies a tile on the map

  suitable buildings.

- A person can equip certain items, such as tools, weapons, clothing, and armor.

- Equipping enables certain tasks and immediate actions.

- People can work together on certain tasks.

- Tasks that allow cooperation have one person leading the task, and others

- People become part of your nation by various means:

  - They are born from an existing person in your nation.

  - They are rescued from the wilderness.

  - They defect to your nation due to unhappiness.

  - Their village decides to join your nation voluntarily.

  - They are captured involuntarily (slave)

- Some tasks require certain tools, or are enhanced by them:

  - Clearing requires an axe, aided by a cart.

  - Gathering is aided by a basket, pottery, or shears.

  - Collecting is aided by a basket or cart.

  - Farming requires a plough, is aided by rake, shovel, cart, basket.

  - Cooking requires pottery, is aided by knives.

  - Mining requires shovel, pick-axe, is aided by cart and basket.

  - Fishing is enhanced by spears, nets, or boats.

- Some tasks require or are enhanced by resources:

  - Farming requires water, is aided by seeds, horses and oxen.

  - Cooking requires food, water, and wood. Is aided by spices.

  - Mining requires wood. Is aided by water.

- Many tasks require buildings:

  - Farming is performed on tiles surrounding a building only.

  - Cooking is performed in a building only.

  - Crafting and smithing require buildings.

- Buildings have several general uses:

  - Allow people to stack (multiple people per building)

  - Allow storage of resources and goods.

  - Protect people from elements, facilitate healing.

  - Protect people from attack or wild animals.

  - Enhance defensive positions.

  - Enable certain tasks not possible outdoors.

- People have health. 

  - Health is negatively affected by lack of food or water, over exposure,
    or injury during battle or by hostile animals.

  - A person dies at zero health.

  - Health does not recover when a person is exposed to the elements.

  - Health is depleted if stamina cannot be recovered due to environmental
    factors (see below).

  - Health recovers moderately when resting in a shelter.

  - Health can be recovered more quickly via certain remedies and herbs.

  - A person who is "resilient" has more health than usual.

  - A person who is "healthy" recovers health more quickly than usual.

- People have stamina.

  - Stamina is a short term measure of the amount of energy a person has.

  - Stamina is depleted by movement, work, and environmental exposure.

  - Stamina automatically recovers a certain amount before and after each
    turn. This amount decreases if the person is injured.

  - Health does not recover unless stamina is kept full for an entire
    turn (rest).
  
  - The distance a person can move is determined by their stamina.

  - If a person attacks or is attacked, it drains their stamina.

  - If a person with no remaining stamina is attacked, they are considered
    defenseless and take a damage penalty.

  - Therefore event a strong person can be vulnerable to attack by a large number
    of relatively weak adversaries.

  - A person who is "fast" has more stamina than normal.

  - A person who is "strong" recovers stamina faster than usual.

- People can move each turn, which is affected by their stamina, equipment, the
  environment, and mount.
  
  - Moving uses stamina. An unencumbered normal person can move
    3 tiles along flat ground before exhausting their stamina.

  - Performing an attack uses all remaining stamina.

  - Items, such as weapons, tools, armor and goods increase encumberance.

  - Encumberance increases the amount of stamina required to move or attack.

  - Hills require twice as much stamina to enter as flat ground.

  - Mountains and glacier are generally impassible except with special
    equipment or mount.

  - Entering an acquatic land tile (river or marsh) uses all remaining
    stamina. Stamina recovers half as quickly while swimming. If stamina
    remains zero while in water, a person can drown.

  - A horse reduces the amount of stamina required for movement by 2.

  - Mounting an oxen removes all stamina requirements for movement, but
    can travel only 2 tiles per turn. Normal rules for acquatic tiles
    still apply, however.

  - A boat encumbers a person on land, but reduces stamina by 2x on rivers and
    coast. Boats cannot enter deep ocean (ships can, but are not carried).

  - High rider skill can reduce stamina requirement on horseback.

  - A cart allows goods to be carried without encumberance on flat ground.

  - Road improvements to tiles will also improve movement.

  - Roads will be graduated starting with trails, to dirt roads to stone paved vias.

- Sight range is a product of terrain for the most part.

  - Over flat terrain a person can see a radius of 3 tiles away.

  - Buildings themselves have no site. 

  - Line of site is blocked by tiles higher than a person.

  - Line of site is blocked by forests and jungle at the same level.

  - Line of site is blocked by buildings at the same level.

  - Hills are higher than flat ground, and mountains higher than hills.

  - Mountain tiles are visible from farther away since they protrude from the
    horizon.

  - Standing on a hill extends sight across lower terrain by one tile.

  - Standing on a mountain, where possible, extends sight by two tiles.

  - When on a boat in water, normal site rules apply.

  - When on a ship in water, sight rules apply as if the person was standing
    one level higher. On ocean, this is as if standing on a hill.

  - When swimming, sight radius is reduces by 1.

  - A "perceptive" person has their site radius increased by 1.

  - There may be items (spyglass?) that improve site range.

  - There may be buildings (watchtower?) that improve site range.

  - Most ranged attacks cannot be made out of the site range of the attacker even
    if the tile is visible by another person.

  - Therefore buildings, forests, hills, and mountains block most range attacks.

  - Certain ranged seige attacks may be made blind with a damage penalty.

  - Maybe it should be possible to stand on buildings?

- Slaves are involuntary people in your nation.

  - Slaves cannot equip items.

  - Slave are limited to simple tasks such as laboring, collecting, foraging.

  - Slaves are always unhappy, other happiness effects are ignored.

  - Slaves have half the health of normal people.

  - Slaves receive only half the normal food as normal people.

  - Slaves are more like resources than people, and thus can be traded.

  - A normal person can be made a slave. This causes unhappiness in nearby
    people.

  - Slaves can become normal citizens after a number of years in the empire.
    This makes that person happy.

  - Slaves can spawn other slaves.

  - Slaves left unguarded (if their master dies or leaves without them) may
    escape or defect.

  - Slaves are assigned a master, by default they labor for this person.

  - Slaves are not counted as part of the population, thus do not contribute
    to any population effects.

  - Slaves can attack and defend, but poorly due to their lack of equipment.

  - Slaves do not accumulate skills or experience, but may aid their master in
    doing so.

  - Slaves may steal items?

- Mercinaries

  - Warfare is very expensive, as a result soldiers may be available for hire.

  - Villages may offer soldiers in exchange for goods.

  - These soldiers come equipped, but may be equipped with your own items.

  - These soldiers will require payment of goods each turn.

  - Failure to pay will result in the soldiers immediate leaving your control.

  - You may dismiss mercinaries at any time.

  - Mercinaries can perform non-combat tasks, but become unhappy when doing
    so.

  - Mercinaries always have neutral happiness otherwise.

  - You may sell mercinaries of your own to other nations or villages.

  - Mercinaries have a fixed contract duration.

  - Mercinaries do not spawn.

  - Mercinaries may steal items?

  - Mercinaries will not attack persons of their own village or allies.
  
  - They will turn on you if you attack their people.
