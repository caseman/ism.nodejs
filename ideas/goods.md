## Food
 
  - Types

      - Fruits and vegtables which can be gathered and eaten raw or cooked.
        Do not spoil rapidly. Fruits can be made into wine to keep.

      - Grains which can be gathered or farmed. They keep well, but must be
        cooked into bread, or brewed into beer to be consumed.

      - Meat spoils quickly unless cooked. And can be preserved with special 
        skills or in winter.

      - Milk is similar to meat and spoils quickly when warm. To preserve it
        must be made into cheese.

  - Gathering

      - Gathering finds vegetable food that is available in the environment.

      - Gathering is least efficient, but requires no tools, resources or
        buildings.

      - Once gathered, food in a tile will be depleted but will be restored
        in some number of turns. While depleted the tile is marked "gathered"

      - Gathering is enhanced by baskets, or shears.

      - Perceptive people receive a bonus while gathering.

      - Grassland provides the most when gathered, followed by plains,
        forest, jungle, marsh, etc.

      - Gathering benefits from any vegetable-food related special 
        resources like wheat, grapes, apples, nuts.

  - Hunting

      - Hunting provides meat from animals in the wild. It can also
        provide fur and hides.

      - Hunting requires knives, and benefits from any ranged weapons.

      - Hunting requires a shelter for the hunter. This may be a
        permanent or temporary building.

      - It provides more than gathering, but meat must be cooked or
        it spoils within a few turns.

      - Hunting is generally not a permanent activity since it is
        dependent on the precense of animals that may migrate.

    - Fishing

      - Fishing provides meat from water tiles. It can be performed on
        land adjacent to water, or in a boat on water. The latter is
        much more effective.

      - Fishing requires knives and spears, and benefits from nets.

      - Fishing requires some shelter as with hunting.

      - Fish must be cooked like meat to prevent spoiling.

      - Availability of fish is fairly constant, and special fish
        resources greatly increase yield.

      - Fishing generally produces smaller, but more consistent amounts of
        meat than hunting.

    - Grain Farming
      
      - Farming allows improved land tiles to yield food during 
        spring, summer, and fall assuming the tile is free of snow.

      - Only grassland or plains tiles can be farmed.
     
      - To farm a tile, it must be cleared and ploughed.

      - The farmer must have a permanent shelter. Tiles surrounding
        the shelter will be farmed.

      - Farming requires a plough, and benefits from seed, shovel,
        rake.

      - Farms must have access to fresh water, either via a river or
        well.

      - Yield may be further improved by seed, manure, and irrigation.

    - Livestock Farming

      - Livestock farming allows animals to be raised efficiently for
        food, hides, or for draught use.
      
      - Livestock consumes grain and water.

      - Livestock requires pasture tiles which can be improved from cleared
        plains or grassland.

    - Cooking

      - Cooking combines raw foods, wood, and water together to produce
        more palatable (i.e, grain -> bread) or more durable (i.e., meat ->
        cooked meat -> jerky) food.
      
      - Cooking requires knives, pottery, and is aided by spices and salt.

      - Specialized forms of cooking include cheese making, beer brewing,
        and wine making.
